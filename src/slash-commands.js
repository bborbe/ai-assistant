 * - `single`: one `/ben` command carrying the same commands as subcommands,
 *   visible to every member.
 *
 * Both shapes are built from ONE list, so the two cannot drift into offering
 * different commands.
 *
 * Its own module because "which commands exist" is a decision worth testing,
 * and index.js logs in at require time so a test cannot reach anything defined
 * there.
 *
 * `voiceEnabled: false` omits the voice subcommands entirely rather than
 * registering them to refuse. A command in the guild's list is a promise the
 * instance can do the thing; a text-only deployment has no speech-to-speech to
 * reach, so the honest surface is for them not to appear at all. The TYPED
 * forms still answer with a reason (see text.js) — that path costs nothing and
 * tells someone who tries anyway why it did not work.

 * entirely, so the owner always sees them without holding anything explicitly.
 *
 * Note what this is NOT: Discord's gate is permission-based, so it cannot
 * express "these user ids". A member holding ManageGuild sees the commands
