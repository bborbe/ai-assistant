 * subscription, answers each message through the SAME session engine the
 * Discord surface uses (llm.chat → shim, X-Session-Key), and replies in-thread
 * via the Chat API. Session keys are `gchat:<spaceId>_<threadId>:<identity>`,
 * disjoint from Discord's `thread:`/`dm:`/`channel:`/`voice:` keyspaces, so the
 * two surfaces never share a conversation (goal SC2).
 *
 * Sender-gated: a message whose address is not on `GCHAT_ALLOWED_EMAILS` gets a
 * short refusal in-thread and never reaches the session engine, which can read
 * the Data Assistant vault.
 *
 * Mirrors the verified Python port (openbrain-googlechatbot, 2026-09-04):
 * envelope parse, session keys, per-message triage verdict log line,
 * threading-aware reply, reply-then-ack (a failed reply nacks → redelivery,
