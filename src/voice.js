   * Push a typed turn into this session's own s2s socket so it is answered
   * aloud through the playback path already wired for spoken turns — see the
   * design note in [[Typed messages cannot be answered aloud]]. No second TTS
   * path: the reply returns through the existing `response.output_audio.delta`
   * -> `pushAudio` route once the server accepts the request below.
   *
   * Two events per the realtime protocol: `conversation.item.create` adds the
   * text to the LLM context without triggering generation, `response.create`
   * triggers it. The server acks with `response.created`, or refuses cleanly
   * with `conversation_already_has_active_response` if a response is already
   * in flight (response.py:150).
   *
   * **Why this gates on `inResponse`/`awaitingSpeakAck` before sending
   * anything**, rather than just racing the next `response.created` off the
   * shared socket: the server auto-generates a response for a MIC turn via
   * VAD with no client `response.create` at all, so a bare event-type match
   * cannot tell "the ack for MY request" from "someone else on the call just
   * finished a sentence". Gating first — refusing as `busy` client-side when
   * a response is already known to be in flight, and refusing a second
   * concurrent `speak()` the same way — closes that window down to the
   * network round-trip between the check and the send, which is the same
   * residual race the server itself accepts (its own gate is a plain
   * boolean, not a queue). Still not a client-side response STATE MACHINE:
   * `inResponse` only mirrors what the server already reports on every
   * `response.created`/`response.done`, it decides nothing on its own.
   *
   * Accepted tradeoff: once `conversation.item.create` is actually sent, a
   * `timeout` or a lost-race `no-socket` (via `connectS2S()`'s reconnect
   * hook) is reported to the caller, but the item itself is never retracted
   * — the server has no "cancel this item" message, and the deferred-item
   * flush in conversation.py means it may still surface in the transcript
   * later, attributed correctly to the user, just without a spoken reply
   * this turn. The common busy case never reaches this window at all,
   * because the gate above refuses before sending anything.
