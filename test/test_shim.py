"""Tests for shim/claude_openai_shim.py.

The shim had no tests at all until 2026-08-10, which is how a change to session
keys silently disabled the wake phrase in a live meeting: `make precommit` runs
`node --test`, and the shim is Python, so nothing here was ever executed by a
check. These cover the decisions that are cheap to get wrong and expensive to
notice — classification and key routing — not the HTTP or subprocess plumbing.
