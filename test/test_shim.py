"""Tests for shim/claude_openai_shim.py.

The shim had no tests at all until 2026-08-10, which is how a change to session
keys silently disabled the wake phrase in a live meeting: `make precommit` runs
`node --test`, and the shim is Python, so nothing here was ever executed by a
check. These cover the decisions that are cheap to get wrong and expensive to
notice — classification and key routing — not the HTTP or subprocess plumbing.

    assistant reached OpenBrain" could not be proven from a live turn, only
    inferred from the answer text. `Map What the Deployed Data Assistant Can
    Reach` could not close its second criterion because of it.

    Drives the real `ClaudeProcess.ask` over a synthetic stream instead of
    asserting on source text: the claim is "this turn emits that line, a plain
    turn does not", and only running the loop can show it. `on_text` is left
    None so no sentence is ever spoken — `emit_sentences` returns early on it,
    which is what keeps this off the audio path entirely.
