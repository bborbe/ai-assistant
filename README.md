# discord-assistant

One Discord bot that reaches an **OpenAI-compatible endpoint** from two surfaces — text and voice — so the backend behind it can be swapped without touching the bot.

```
Discord (cloud)
   |  outbound gateway — no ingress, no tunnel
discord-assistant  (single Node service, single bot identity)
   |-- text    DM / thread    ------------------> OpenAI-compatible endpoint
   \-- voice   /join, /leave  -> speech-to-speech -> same endpoint
```

Today that endpoint is MiniMax. Later it is a wrapper around a Claude Code session, and neither surface changes — only `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.

## Why one service

One Discord bot identity permits one gateway connection, so text and voice must live in one process. Splitting them across runtimes would need two bot _applications_ — two names, two invites — defeating the point of a single assistant. They also share the sender allowlist, which should be one list rather than two that drift.

## Status

Both surfaces work, verified end to end against a real Claude Code session:

- **Text** — DM, or `@mention` in a guild channel. A mention opens a **thread** and the conversation continues there, so follow-ups need no `@` and history stays scoped to the thread rather than to whatever else the channel was discussing. DMs stay flat — Discord has no threads in DMs.
- **Voice** — `/join` from a voice channel, talk, hear the reply. Barge-in supported.
- **Sender allowlist** on both surfaces, failing closed.
- **One conversation per surface** — each thread, DM and channel keeps its own Claude Code session. A voice channel is a single conversation covering both what is spoken and what is typed in its chat; a DM is a different one. See [Sessions](#sessions).
- **Session control** — `new`, `sessions`, `switch <id>`: start fresh, see what is bound where, or pick up a session started at the desk.

Not built yet: proactive outbound (the bot speaking unprompted, e.g. reporting a finished job), automatic session expiry, and Telegram as a second transport.

## Requirements

- Node 22+
- A running [speech-to-speech](https://github.com/huggingface/speech-to-speech) in realtime mode for the voice surface
- An OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- A Discord bot token — kept in TeamVault, never on disk

## Run

```bash
make install
cp local.env.example local.env      # gitignored; holds the TeamVault key, not the token

# text only — no speech-to-speech needed
DISCORD_TOKEN=$(teamvault-cli password <secret-id>) \
ALLOWED_USER_IDS=<your-discord-user-id> \
  make run

# add voice: speech-to-speech in realtime mode, LLM slot pointed at the same endpoint
S2S_MODE=realtime ~/Documents/workspaces/scripts/s2s-minimax
```

DM the bot to use text. `/join` from a voice channel to use voice, `/leave` to stop.

To put Claude Code behind it instead of a hosted model, run `make shim` and point `OPENAI_BASE_URL` at it.

See `local.env.example` for the full set.

There is **no committed env file** on purpose. Make variables override the environment, so a committed `export DISCORD_TOKEN=` — even an empty one — silently clobbers whatever you exported in your shell. Config lives in gitignored `local.env`; `make run` fails with a pointer to the template if it is missing.

## The shim — Claude Code behind an OpenAI endpoint

`shim/claude_openai_shim.py` exposes **persistent, keyed Claude Code sessions** as `/v1/chat/completions` — one per conversation, so a turn continues where that conversation left off instead of starting cold.

### Configuring it

Optional YAML at `~/.config/discord-assistant/config.yaml` (`DISCORD_ASSISTANT_CONFIG` to move it) — see `config.example.yaml`. Precedence is **environment > file > default**, so a k8s ConfigMap or a one-off `SHIM_*` var still wins and an instance with no file behaves as it always did.

One instance, one config — no profiles. Two configurations means two deployments, which is what k8s is for. **No secrets**: this file is not gitignored, so it names TeamVault key _ids_ and the launcher resolves them.

The setting worth knowing is `claude_script`:

```yaml
claude_script: ~/Documents/workspaces/scripts/cc-personal
```

Without it the shim spawns a bare `claude`, which sees nothing outside `cwd` — so the bot could read the vault and nothing else, while a desk session launched by the same wrapper could read every repo. That gap is invisible until `switch` picks up a desk session and it can no longer open a file its own history shows it reading. Naming the launcher instead of restating its flags is how `vault-cli` avoids the same drift.

⚠️ It widens blast radius on purpose: the launcher's `--add-dir` set becomes readable by everyone on the Discord allowlist, and `cc-personal` adds `~/Documents/workspaces`. Unset by default.

### The contract

It is OpenAI-**shaped but stateful**, a deliberate deviation:

| Role            | Handling     | Why                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `system`        | pass through | per-request output rules (voice clients send speech rules) |
| latest `user`   | the turn     | the actual new input                                       |
| everything else | **discard**  | the session already has the history                        |

Clients resend full history per the spec; appending it to a session that already has it would double context every turn and fork into a second, divergent history. Dropping it is what lets a _stateful_ endpoint slot in under a bot written for a stateless one, with only a base-URL change.

For voice it additionally **enforces** speakable output — a session with a personal `CLAUDE.md` follows its own formatting rules (status panels, markdown, bullet lists), which are unusable as speech and which the voice prompt alone does not override.

### Sessions

The bot sends an extra-spec `X-Session-Key`; the shim maps it to a Claude Code session uuid, persisted in `~/.claude/shim-sessions.json` so the mapping outlives both processes. Locks are per key, so two threads answer at once rather than queueing.

| Surface                              | Key                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Guild thread                         | `thread:<channelId>`  |
| DM                                   | `dm:<userId>`         |
| Guild channel, un-threaded           | `channel:<channelId>` |
| Voice — spoken **and** its text chat | `default`             |

**A voice channel is one conversation.** Speech reaches the endpoint through speech-to-speech, which owns the HTTP call and cannot set a header, so every spoken turn lands on `default`; messages typed in that channel's chat are mapped to the same key deliberately. Talking and typing during a call therefore reach one session — and the session commands, which take their key from the channel they are typed in, reach the spoken conversation rather than an unused one beside it.

**Text elsewhere is separate.** A DM or a thread is its own conversation with its own history; saying something aloud and then DMing it reaches two different sessions.

Note that `default` is a single key for **all** voice, because speech-to-speech has no notion of which channel a turn came from. Two voice channels share one conversation.

Each thread is likewise its own conversation, not a view onto a shared one. An endpoint that ignores the header (any hosted model) treats every turn as stateless and relies on the resent history instead — the bot behaves the same either way.

Threading requires **Create Public Threads** and **Send Messages in Threads**. Without them the bot logs a warning and answers in the channel instead of losing the reply.

Three commands manage them, as slash commands or typed words:

| Command       | Effect                                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new`         | Fresh session here. The old one stays on disk and the reply quotes its id         |
| `sessions`    | What is bound where, plus transcripts you can switch to, labelled by first prompt |
| `switch <id>` | Point this conversation at an existing session                                    |

Typed in a **voice channel's chat**, all three act on the spoken conversation — so `switch <id>` there picks up a session you started at the desk and lets you continue it by talking.

`switch` refuses two things: an id with no transcript (otherwise `--resume` fails on the _next_ turn, far from the cause), and an id already bound to another key (two keys on one session file defeats per-key locking). It cannot see a session open in an interactive `claude` at the desk, since that is not in the shim's mapping — binding to one puts two writers on a single transcript.

Inspect with `status` in Discord, or `curl -s localhost:8080/v1/sessions`. The `id` is an ordinary Claude Code session id: `claude --resume <id>` opens the same conversation at the desk. Resetting is safe only because the session is a cache — the vault is the record.

## `status` — checking the legs live

`/status`, or a typed `status` / `selfcheck`. Every leg is probed rather than reported from config: "the endpoint is configured at :8080" is a different claim from "the endpoint answers", and only the second is worth reading when something is broken. Available over both transports on purpose — a diagnostic sharing a transport with the thing it diagnoses is useless exactly when it is needed.

It also names the **Claude Code session** answering the current channel:

```
🧠 claude sessions — 3 known
   • here `dm:2657…` — `b64cfb24-fa1f-4f1e-9903-48568e30d9f3`, warm, 12 turn(s), 41m
```

The id is what `claude --resume <id>` takes, so the conversation the bot has been holding can be opened at the desk. `warm` / `cold` says whether a live process is behind it — the key/id mapping is persisted and outlives the process, so a cold session answers correctly but pays a spawn first.

Against an endpoint with no `/sessions` route the line says so and the rest still works.

## Service endpoints

`/healthz` (liveness), `/readiness` (gateway connected — 503 while draining), `/version`.

Liveness deliberately ignores Discord: an outage there should drain traffic, not restart every pod into a reconnect storm.

## Three things the bridge has to get right

Each of these was found the hard way; none is obvious from the docs.

1. **Inject silence during gaps.** Discord emits audio _only while someone speaks_, but speech-to-speech's VAD closes a turn _on silence_. Without a fixed-rate ticker sending silence between utterances the turn never ends and no reply is ever generated. This is the single thing that makes the bridge work.

2. **Never send `input_audio_buffer.commit` or `response.create`.** They race the VAD-driven response and show up server-side as `speech during pending response: cancelled`.

3. **Audio arrives as `response.output_audio.delta`**, not `response.audio.delta`. The latter is what OpenAI's hosted Realtime uses and what most write-ups quote — a bot written to it receives nothing and fails silently.

## Audio conversion

Discord is 48 kHz stereo interleaved; speech-to-speech is 16 kHz mono (`PIPELINE_SAMPLE_RATE`). Note this is **not** the 24 kHz that OpenAI's hosted Realtime uses.

Naive `pcm[::3]` is wrong twice over: it walks alternating channels on an interleaved stream, and decimating without a low-pass filter aliases. The bridge mixes to mono first, then averages groups of 3 (box low-pass) going down, and linearly interpolates going up. Crude but correct in shape, and adequate for speech — no ffmpeg required.

## Gotchas

- **`selfDeaf: false` is mandatory** on `joinVoiceChannel`. The default deafens the bot and it receives nothing, silently.
- **A connection stuck in `signalling` means permissions** — even when `permissionsFor(me)` reports `Connect`/`Speak`/`ViewChannel`/`UseVAD` all `true`. Trust the state machine over the permission API, and always log `conn.on('stateChange')`; otherwise the failure surfaces as an unhandled `AbortError` with no cause.
- **Run `generateDependencyReport()` first** on any voice problem — it rules out the whole Opus/encryption class in one command.
- **Discord's portal blocks auto-generated install links for private apps.** Set Installation → Install Link → None and hand-build the OAuth2 URL; keep Public Bot off.

## Deployment

- **[docs/deploy-local.md](docs/deploy-local.md)** — macOS, launchd. Unattended: starts at login, survives sleep/wake, no terminal.
- **[docs/deploy-kubernetes.md](docs/deploy-kubernetes.md)** — coming soon. The image and manifests exist and have never been applied; that page records what is actually built and what still blocks it.

**Never scale beyond one replica** — a Discord bot identity permits exactly one gateway connection, which is why `k8s/` pins `replicas: 1` with `strategy: Recreate`. The same constraint means a cluster instance and a laptop instance cannot run at once on one identity.

## Running it

```bash
make dev                     # shim + speech-to-speech + transcriber + bot
SKIP_VOICE=1 make dev        # text surface only — starts in seconds
SKIP_TRANSCRIBER=1 make dev  # no voice transcription
```

`make dev` reuses anything already listening rather than fighting it, and waits for each port instead of sleeping a fixed time (model load is variable). Individually: `make shim`, `make run`.

| Process          | Port | Needed for                        |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------------------------------- |
| shim             | 8080 | both surfaces                     |
| speech-to-speech | 8765 | voice only (~60 s to load models) |
| transcriber      | —    | per-speaker transcripts           |
| bot              | 8081 | both                              |

The transcriber has no port, so nothing fails loudly when it is missing — the transcript file just stops growing.

## patches/

`speech-to-speech` needs one change for MiniMax (see `patches/README.md`). It lives here because that repo is a third-party clone — a `git pull` silently discards it, and the voice surface then fails in a way that looks unrelated.

## tools/

Diagnostics from the spikes that proved each leg, kept because they isolate faults the full bridge can't:

- `capture.js` — join a channel, capture one speaker, write raw 48 kHz stereo WAV. Proves voice receive with no endpoint involved.
- `to16k.py` — mono mix + `soxr` HQ resample to 16 kHz.
- `transcriber.py` — watches for voice segments and appends the speaker-labelled transcript. Dependencies are declared inline (PEP 723), so `uv run` resolves them and no speech-to-speech checkout is needed.
- `realtime_probe.py` — send a WAV to the speech-to-speech realtime socket and report every event type it emits. Proves the endpoint with no Discord involved; the reference for the protocol handling in `src/voice.js`.
